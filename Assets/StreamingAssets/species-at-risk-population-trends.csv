In 2020, the Canadian population was estimated at 1,432,595 mature individuals. The best available information suggests a decline of 94.4% in the overall Canadian population over the past 10 years. The decline is attributed to losses from the Rivière des Mille-Îles subpopulation, which was 99% of the total Canadian population in 2007. It saw a dramatic decline in 2010 and later stabilized.
